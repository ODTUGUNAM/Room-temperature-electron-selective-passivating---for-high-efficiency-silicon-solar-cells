## How to use this repository

This repository shares the SCAPS simulation files and supporting material used in our JV fitting and analysis.

### Repository structure
- **Typical device fits**: SCAPS files fitted to representative devices (fits based on **mean/average JV metrics**).
- **Champion fits**: SCAPS files fitted to **champion devices**. The **experimental champion JV metrics** used as fitting targets are included in this folder.
- **Figures**: Figures used in the manuscript / supporting material.

### Running the simulations
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the relevant SCAPS file (typical vs champion) in **SCAPS**.
3. Run the simulation to reproduce the JV fit and use the provided parameter sets as a starting point for comparisons or sensitivity sweeps.

### More details
A **PDF in the main directory** includes additional simulation results and a discussion addressing referee suggestions and requests for readers who want deeper modeling context.
